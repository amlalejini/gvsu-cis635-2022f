This enables us to write nicely formatted documents with R code (and output from your R code) embedded directly in the document. Find examples of compiled R markdown documents here: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html In fact, this page is generated with R Markdown! Source code for this page here. 2.1 Dependencies To use R markdown, you’ll need to install the following packages: markdown and rmarkdown. You should also want to go ahead and install the tinytex package (+ install TinyTex) to be able generate PDF output from your R Markdown documents. See the instructions below! 2.1.1 Installing R packages As previously mentioned, there are many R packages (&gt; 18,000!) with all sorts of useful functionality. To install an R package, use the install.packages function in your R console (e.g., in RStudio). Run ?install.packages in your R console to read its help page. To install the markdown and rmarkdown packages, run the following command in your R console: install.packages(c(&quot;markdown&quot;, &quot;rmarkdown&quot;)) Once the installations finish, you should be able to run the following two commands without errors: library(markdown) library(rmarkdown) For this class, you’ll also need to be able to generate PDF output from your R Markdown documents. To do so, you’ll need to instal LaTex (if you’re not sure what that is, no worries!). Run the following two commands in your R console in RStudio: install.packages(&#39;tinytex&#39;) tinytex::install_tinytex() 2.2 Create a new R Markdown document in RStudio Click the new file button in the top right of the RStudio window, and select R Markdown. In RStudio, you should get a pop-up for creating a new r markdown document. For now, there are two relevant options: Click the “Create Empty Document” in the bottom left of the popup. This will create an empty R markdown file for you. Fill out the title, author (you!), and date fields and press “Okay”. This will create a new R markdown file, but RStudio will initialize your file with a bunch of stuff (this stuff is helpful information, but you will want to delete it all for any assignments in this class). 2.3 Anatomy of an R Markdown document There are three basic components in an R Markdown document: the metadata, text, and code. Here’s the contents for a minimal R Markdown document (from https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/basics.html): An R Markdown document should be a plain text file (i.e., don’t try to write one in google docs or microsoft word!) and conventionally has the .Rmd file extension. 2.3.1 Frontmatter (metadata) The metadata (or the frontmatter) specifies how your R Markdown should be compiled. E.g., the output file type, whether to include a table of contents, etc. The metadata should be written between a pair of three dashes --- at the top of your document (see minimal example). For now, don’t worry too much about what you should include in your document metadata. For the most part, you can just use what RStudio includes in your document. 2.3.2 Text The body of your document follows the metadata. Any text (i.e., everything that isn’t code) you include in your document should follow markdown syntax. If you’re not already familiar with markdown, read over this: https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started. For basic markdown syntax, see: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/. Being familiar with basic syntax should be just about everything you need for your homework assignments in this class. For more advanced markdown syntax, see: https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/. You can also refer to Section 2.5 in R Markdown: The Definitive Guide for more info on markdown. 2.3.3 Code In general, you can include code in your R Markdown documents in two ways: Inline code begin with `r and end with a `. E.g., 2 would render the result of log(4, base=2) inline. You can include a “code chunk” inside your R Markdown document. A code chunk begins with three backticks ```{r} and end with three backticks (see minimal example above for an example). There are many options tha tyou can specify in the {} at the beginning of a code chunk. See https://yihui.org/knitr/options/ for details. 2.4 “Knitting” To compile an R Markdown document into a PDF or HTML file, you need to “Knit” it. In RStudio, this is pretty straightforward. Just click the “Knit” button on your document in RStudio. 2.5 Resources R Markdown: The Definitive Guide Code chunk options: https://yihui.org/knitr/options/ "],["homework-1.html", "Chapter 3 Homework 1 3.1 Setup 3.2 Part A. Use R as a calculator 3.3 Part B. Built-in Functions 3.4 Part C. Creating vectors 3.5 Part D. Subsetting vectors 3.6 Part E. Types of data", " Chapter 3 Homework 1 This goal of this homework is as follows: Give you an opportunity to practice some R programming basics Make sure you are comfortable creating and knitting an R Markdown document Grading Each question is weighted evenly 3.1 Setup Make sure you have access to a computer with R and RStudio installed (with the ability to install new packages). If you do not, let me know as soon as possible! If you have not done so already, install R and RStudio (step-by-step guides provided in week 1 course content). I strongly encourage you to stay organized. I recommend that you directory on your computer where you can save all of your work for this class (e.g., “cis635” would make for a good name). Within that directory, I recommend keeping each of your homework assignments and projects separated into their own directories. For example, I might organize things as follows: cis635/ homeworks/ hw01 hw02 ... project/ ... Create a new R Markdown file with the title “Homework 1” and with you as the author (hint: this information will go into your R Markdown frontmatter at the top of the file). In your R markdown file, create a section heading for each of the following parts of your homework: Part A. Use R as a calculator Part B. Built-in Functions Part C. Creating vectors Part D. Subsetting vectors Part E. Types of data 3.2 Part A. Use R as a calculator Under your Part A heading, write one code chunk for each of the following calculations: \\[ 1+2(3+4) \\] \\[ log_2(4^3 + 3^{2+1}) \\] \\[ \\sqrt{(4+3)(2+1)} \\] For example, if the calculation is 2 + 2, your code chunk should look something like this when your R Markdown document is compiled: 2+2 ## [1] 4 I want to see each equation translated directly into code. Do not simplify any of the calculations (e.g., 2+1 should be 2+1 in your code, not 3). 3.3 Part B. Built-in Functions A built-in function is one that comes pre-loaded in R (you don’t need to install and load a package to use). To learn how to use a built-in loaded function that you don’t know how to use appropriately, use the help() function. help() takes one parameter, the name of the function that you want information about (e.g., help(abs)). Instead of the help function, you could also use enter ? and then the name of the function in your R console (e.g., ?abs). Familiarize yourself with the built-in functions abs(), round(), sqrt(), tolower(), and toupper(). Under your Part B heading, use these built-in functions to write code that prints the following items (put each of these into a different code chunk in your R Markdown document): The absolute value of -15.5. 4.483847 rounded to one decimal place. The function round() takes two arguments, the number to be rounded and the number of decimal places. “species” in all capital letters. “SPECIES” in all lower case letters. 3.4 Part C. Creating vectors Under your Part C heading, Create the following vectors using just seq() and/or rep(). (don’t use c()) Positive integers from 1 to 99 Odd integers between 1 and 99 The numbers 1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3 (hint: read the help pages for seq and rep!) 3.5 Part D. Subsetting vectors Under your Part D heading, use subsetting syntax (square brackets) to write code that completes the following using the vector y. y &lt;- c(3,2,15,-1,22,1,9,17,5) Display only the first value of y. Display the last value of y, in a way that would work if y were any length. (hint: ?length) Display only the values in y that are greater than the mean of y. 3.6 Part E. Types of data Under your part E heading, using the vector y write code that completes the following tasks: y &lt;- c(3,2,15,-1,22,1,9,17,5) Make a logical (TRUE/FALSE) vector describing which values in y are positive. Make a logical vector describing whether any of the values of y are equal to the mean of y. Coerce the vector you just made (in #2 above) from a logical vector to a character vector. Make a logical vector describing whether any of the values of y are equal to the median of y. Coerce the vector you just made (in #4 above) into a categorial vector (using factor()). Make a matrix with 4 rows and 3 columns that looks like this: ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 2 3 ## [2,] 4 5 6 ## [3,] 7 8 9 ## [4,] 10 11 12 Coerce that matrix into a dataframe.

I would encourage you to download that Rmd file, open it own your own computer in RStudio, and run the code chunks on your own (and modify things as you wish!). In this tutorial, We’ll go over argument order and default values when calling functions in R We’ll go over the basics of writing functions in R 5.1 Argument order and default values As you encountered last week, R has many built-in functions (e.g., abs, round, etc), and all of R packages that you install provide even more functions that you can use. Using an existing function is simple. Write the name of the function you want to use followed by the requisite arguments in parentheses. For example, value &lt;- -15 abs(value) ## [1] 15 or, log(4, base=2) ## [1] 2 If you look at the documentation for abs (enter ?abs into your R console), there’s only one argument (x), and x is required (i.e., notice that it has no default values). In contrast, run ?log function in your R console. Notice that there are two possible arguments for log, x and base. x is required, as it has no default value, but base is optional, defaulting to exp(1) if not provided. Let’s say we want to take the \\(log_3\\) of 27. To do so, we’ll need to specify both the x and base arguments, but there are a few ways that we can do that. For example, we could call log with each argument in the correct position: log(27, 3) ## [1] 3 We could call log as I did above with log(4, base=2): log(27, base=3) ## [1] 3 In this case, R relies on argument position to deduce which argument is which up until the first named variable. We could also specify all arguments using their names: log(x=27, base=3) ## [1] 3 If you specify arguments this way (using their names), argument order doesn’t matter. log(base=3, x=27) ## [1] 3 When calling a function with multiple arguments, I strongly encourage you to specify arguments by name. 5.2 Writing your own functions To write a function in R, the general structure is as follows: my_function &lt;- function(parameters) { # Perform some actions using the given parameters. # Optionally, return some value } We can write a function that rolls a die for us like so: # This function rolls a six-sided die. # Run ?sample in your console if you&#39;re curious about how the sample function # works. roll &lt;- function() { result &lt;- sample(x = 1:6, size = 1, replace = TRUE) return(result) } Currently, roll_d6 will always simulate rolling a six-sided die. We could modify our function definition to add an argument that specifies the size of the die: # This function simulates rolling a die with a given number of sides. roll &lt;- function(sides) { result &lt;- sample(x = 1:sides, size = 1, replace = TRUE) return(result) } Note that when we run the code chunk above, we are redefining our roll function. Challenge question: Try writing your own roll function that rolls an argument-specified number of dice (where the number of sides of each die is specified by an argument) and then returns the sum of those rolls. 5.3 Return values In the roll functions that we wrote, we explicitly specified what the functions should return. However, if you do not use return() to specify what should be returned, the last evaluated expression is returned automatically. If the last evaluated expression doesn’t produce a value, your function will not return a value. I generally prefer to use explicit return statements because it lets me quickly identify what my functions are returning. Here’s a silly function: silly_function &lt;- function(a) { if (a == 1) { a + 100 } else if (a == 2) { 200 } else if (a == 3) { return(300) } else { } } Try calling silly_function with different inputs to see what it returns. 5.4 Default argument values Just like many built-in functions have some arguments with defualt values, you can define your functions such their arguments have default values. All you need to do is specify the default value of an argument when you define the function. For example, if we wrote a function that calculates the price something with a sales tax included, we might specify a default tax rate for convenience. price_with_tax &lt;- function(price, tax_rate=0.06) { return(price+(price*tax_rate)) } 5.5 Resources Hands-on Programming with R (2.3, 2.4) Software carpentry lesson on writing functions in R "],["reading-and-writing-data.html", "Chapter 6 Reading and Writing Data 6.1 Writing data 6.2 Loading data", " Chapter 6 Reading and Writing Data You can download the R Markdown file used to generate this document (or webpage) here. I would encourage you to download that Rmd file, open it own your own computer in RStudio, and run the code chunks on your own (and modify things as you wish!). In this tutorial: I’ll walk you through how to write data stored in a dataframe as a .csv file. And, I’ll show you how to load data saved in a .csv file into a dataframe. 6.1 Writing data R comes preloaded with many datasets (for a complete list run library(help=\"datasets\")). For example, Orange is a small data set that gives growth data for 5 orange trees. head(Orange) ## Tree age circumference ## 1 1 118 30 ## 2 1 484 58 ## 3 1 664 87 ## 4 1 1004 115 ## 5 1 1231 120 ## 6 1 1372 142 If we wanted to write this dataset out to a csv file, we could use the write.csv function. write.csv(x=Orange, file=&quot;orange_trees.csv&quot;, row.names=FALSE) If you run the above R code, where did orange_trees.csv get saved? (hint: in your current working directory) write.csv has many options. Run ?write.csv in your R console to read the documentation. write.csv will be very useful when you want to clean up or transform a dataset that you’ll be analyzing/working with. If your dataset is large and/or the preprocessing operations you perform are expensive, you don’t want do those operations every time you load your dataset. Instead, write a script to process the dataset and save the processed dataset. 6.2 Loading data Loading data from a csv file is straightfoward. You’ll use the read.csv function. pokemon_df &lt;- read.csv(file=&quot;lecture-material/week-02/data/pokemon.csv&quot;) head(pokemon_df) ## abilities against_bug against_dark against_dragon ## 1 [&#39;Overgrow&#39;, &#39;Chlorophyll&#39;] 1.00 1 1 ## 2 [&#39;Overgrow&#39;, &#39;Chlorophyll&#39;] 1.00 1 1 ## 3 [&#39;Overgrow&#39;, &#39;Chlorophyll&#39;] 1.00 1 1 ## 4 [&#39;Blaze&#39;, &#39;Solar Power&#39;] 0.50 1 1 ## 5 [&#39;Blaze&#39;, &#39;Solar Power&#39;] 0.50 1 1 ## 6 [&#39;Blaze&#39;, &#39;Solar Power&#39;] 0.25 1 1 ## against_electric against_fairy against_fight against_fire against_flying ## 1 0.5 0.5 0.5 2.0 2 ## 2 0.5 0.5 0.5 2.0 2 ## 3 0.5 0.5 0.5 2.0 2 ## 4 1.0 0.5 1.0 0.5 1 ## 5 1.0 0.5 1.0 0.5 1 ## 6 2.0 0.5 0.5 0.5 1 ## against_ghost against_grass against_ground against_ice against_normal ## 1 1 0.25 1 2.0 1 ## 2 1 0.25 1 2.0 1 ## 3 1 0.25 1 2.0 1 ## 4 1 0.50 2 0.5 1 ## 5 1 0.50 2 0.5 1 ## 6 1 0.25 0 1.0 1 ## against_poison against_psychic against_rock against_steel against_water ## 1 1 2 1 1.0 0.5 ## 2 1 2 1 1.0 0.5 ## 3 1 2 1 1.0 0.5 ## 4 1 1 2 0.5 2.0 ## 5 1 1 2 0.5 2.0 ## 6 1 1 4 0.5 2.0 ## attack base_egg_steps base_happiness base_total capture_rate classfication ## 1 49 5120 70 318 45 Seed Pokémon ## 2 62 5120 70 405 45 Seed Pokémon ## 3 100 5120 70 625 45 Seed Pokémon ## 4 52 5120 70 309 45 Lizard Pokémon ## 5 64 5120 70 405 45 Flame Pokémon ## 6 104 5120 70 634 45 Flame Pokémon ## defense experience_growth height_m hp japanese_name name ## 1 49 1059860 0.7 45 Fushigidaneフシギダネ Bulbasaur ## 2 63 1059860 1.0 60 Fushigisouフシギソウ Ivysaur ## 3 123 1059860 2.0 80 Fushigibanaフシギバナ Venusaur ## 4 43 1059860 0.6 39 Hitokageヒトカゲ Charmander ## 5 58 1059860 1.1 58 Lizardoリザード Charmeleon ## 6 78 1059860 1.7 78 Lizardonリザードン Charizard ## percentage_male pokedex_number sp_attack sp_defense speed type1 type2 ## 1 88.1 1 65 65 45 grass poison ## 2 88.1 2 80 80 60 grass poison ## 3 88.1 3 122 120 80 grass poison ## 4 88.1 4 60 50 65 fire ## 5 88.1 5 80 65 80 fire ## 6 88.1 6 159 115 100 fire flying ## weight_kg generation is_legendary ## 1 6.9 1 0 ## 2 13.0 1 0 ## 3 100.0 1 0 ## 4 8.5 1 0 ## 5 19.0 1 0 ## 6 90.5 1 0 One slightly tricky thing to keep in mind about loading data is where R will look for the data you’re loading.

But, if you haven’t, go ahead and run: install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) With the tidyverse packages installed, you’ll need to load the dplyr library to use it. library(dplyr) ## ## Attaching package: &#39;dplyr&#39; ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:stats&#39;: ## ## filter, lag ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:base&#39;: ## ## intersect, setdiff, setequal, union 8.2 Overview This document will cover key dplyr functions that solve the most common data manipulation challenges. The examples and explanations here non-exhaustive (dplyr has a lot of functionality and each of these functions are very flexible). Instead, I’d like you to start building a sense of the broad category of data manipulations that are possible with each of the dplyr functions below. As you encounter challenges with manipulating data, you should have a solid idea of which functions you will need to do what you want to do. Then, you can use those functions’ documentation to work out the specific details. dplyr’s functions for basic data manipulation can be divided into three categories based on the component of the dataset that they work with (descriptions pulled from dplyr documentation): Rows filter() - choose rows in your data based on their column values slice() - choose rows in your data based on their location (index) in the dataset arrange() - change the ordering of rows in your data Columns select() - changes whether or not a column is included rename() - changes the names of columns mutate() - changes the values of columns and can create new columns that are functions of existing columns relocate() - changes the order of columns Groups of rows summarise() - collapses a group of rows into a single row These functions can be used in combination with group_by(), which allows you to perform these functions on particular groups of rows, instead of the entire dataset. Note that the above list of functions is non-exhaustive. I refer you to the dplyr documentation for an exhaustive list. Additionally, I’d encourage you to look over (and save) the cheat sheet linked at the end of this document. 8.3 The pipe operator Most dplyr functions take a dataframe (or tibble) as their first argument. dplyr provides the pipe operator (%&gt;%), which lets you conveniently compose multiple dplyr functions in a single line (instead of needing to save intermediate states of your dataset). The pipe operator “pipes” the results of the left side of the pipe into the first argument of the right side of the pipe. Here’s an example: f &lt;- function(a, b) { return(a + b) } g &lt;- function(a, b) { return(a * b) } x &lt;- 2 y &lt;- 100 x %&gt;% f(y) # Is the same as f(x,y) ## [1] 102 x %&gt;% f(y) %&gt;% g(y) # Is the same as g(f(x,y), y) ## [1] 10200 8.4 Data We’ll use the starwars dataset to demonstrate the basic data manipulation functions provided by dplyr. You don’t need to download anything, the starwars dataset is loaded when you load the dplyr package. dim(starwars) ## [1] 87 14 This dataset has 87 rows and 14 columns where each row represents a character from Star Wars, and each column is a particular attribute. starwars ## # A tibble: 87 × 14 ## name height mass hair_…¹ skin_…² eye_c…³ birth…⁴ sex gender homew…⁵ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Luke Skywa… 172 77 blond fair blue 19 male mascu… Tatooi… ## 2 C-3PO 167 75 &lt;NA&gt; gold yellow 112 none mascu… Tatooi… ## 3 R2-D2 96 32 &lt;NA&gt; white,… red 33 none mascu… Naboo ## 4 Darth Vader 202 136 none white yellow 41.9 male mascu… Tatooi… ## 5 Leia Organa 150 49 brown light brown 19 fema… femin… Aldera… ## 6 Owen Lars 178 120 brown,… light blue 52 male mascu… Tatooi… ## 7 Beru White… 165 75 brown light blue 47 fema… femin… Tatooi… ## 8 R5-D4 97 32 &lt;NA&gt; white,… red NA none mascu… Tatooi… ## 9 Biggs Dark… 183 84 black light brown 24 male mascu… Tatooi… ## 10 Obi-Wan Ke… 182 77 auburn… fair blue-g… 57 male mascu… Stewjon ## # … with 77 more rows, 4 more variables: species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, ## # vehicles &lt;list&gt;, starships &lt;list&gt;, and abbreviated variable names ## # ¹​hair_color, ²​skin_color, ³​eye_color, ⁴​birth_year, ⁵​homeworld If you look closely at the above output, you’ll notice that the starwars dataset is represented as a tibble. A tibble is a more modern version of the dataframe type, and for the most part, anywhere you could use a dataframe, you can use a tibble. You can convert a data frame to tibbles with the as_tible() function. Read more about tibbles here: https://tibble.tidyverse.org/. 8.5 Filter rows with filter() filter() allows you to choose rows in a data frame based on their column values. For example, if we wanted to create a new data frame that only contained droids, we could: starwars %&gt;% filter(species==&quot;Droid&quot;) ## # A tibble: 6 × 14 ## name height mass hair_color skin_color eye_c…¹ birth…² sex gender homew…³ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 C-3PO 167 75 &lt;NA&gt; gold yellow 112 none mascu… Tatooi… ## 2 R2-D2 96 32 &lt;NA&gt; white, bl… red 33 none mascu… Naboo ## 3 R5-D4 97 32 &lt;NA&gt; white, red red NA none mascu… Tatooi… ## 4 IG-88 200 140 none metal red 15 none mascu… &lt;NA&gt; ## 5 R4-P17 96 NA none silver, r… red, b… NA none femin… &lt;NA&gt; ## 6 BB8 NA NA none none black NA none mascu… &lt;NA&gt; ## # … with 4 more variables: species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, vehicles &lt;list&gt;, ## # starships &lt;list&gt;, and abbreviated variable names ¹​eye_color, ²​birth_year, ## # ³​homeworld We can also filter rows based on more complex conditions: starwars %&gt;% filter(species == &quot;Droid&quot; &amp; height &gt; 100) ## # A tibble: 2 × 14 ## name height mass hair_color skin_color eye_co…¹ birth…² sex gender homew…³ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 C-3PO 167 75 &lt;NA&gt; gold yellow 112 none mascu… Tatooi… ## 2 IG-88 200 140 none metal red 15 none mascu… &lt;NA&gt; ## # … with 4 more variables: species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, vehicles &lt;list&gt;, ## # starships &lt;list&gt;, and abbreviated variable names ¹​eye_color, ²​birth_year, ## # ³​homeworld What if we wanted all droids, Wookiees, and Hutts? starwars %&gt;% filter(species == &quot;Droid&quot; | species == &quot;Wookiee&quot; | species == &quot;Hutt&quot;) ## # A tibble: 9 × 14 ## name height mass hair_…¹ skin_…² eye_c…³ birth…⁴ sex gender homew…⁵ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 C-3PO 167 75 &lt;NA&gt; gold yellow 112 none mascu… Tatooi… ## 2 R2-D2 96 32 &lt;NA&gt; white,… red 33 none mascu… Naboo ## 3 R5-D4 97 32 &lt;NA&gt; white,… red NA none mascu… Tatooi… ## 4 Chewbacca 228 112 brown unknown blue 200 male mascu… Kashyy… ## 5 Jabba Desil… 175 1358 &lt;NA&gt; green-… orange 600 herm… mascu… Nal Hu… ## 6 IG-88 200 140 none metal red 15 none mascu… &lt;NA&gt; ## 7 R4-P17 96 NA none silver… red, b… NA none femin… &lt;NA&gt; ## 8 Tarfful 234 136 brown brown blue NA male mascu… Kashyy… ## 9 BB8 NA NA none none black NA none mascu… &lt;NA&gt; ## # … with 4 more variables: species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, vehicles &lt;list&gt;, ## # starships &lt;list&gt;, and abbreviated variable names ¹​hair_color, ²​skin_color, ## # ³​eye_color, ⁴​birth_year, ⁵​homeworld Even more simply with the %in% operator, starwars %&gt;% filter(species %in% c(&quot;Droid&quot;, &quot;Wookiee&quot;, &quot;Hutt&quot;)) ## # A tibble: 9 × 14 ## name height mass hair_…¹ skin_…² eye_c…³ birth…⁴ sex gender homew…⁵ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 C-3PO 167 75 &lt;NA&gt; gold yellow 112 none mascu… Tatooi… ## 2 R2-D2 96 32 &lt;NA&gt; white,… red 33 none mascu… Naboo ## 3 R5-D4 97 32 &lt;NA&gt; white,… red NA none mascu… Tatooi… ## 4 Chewbacca 228 112 brown unknown blue 200 male mascu… Kashyy… ## 5 Jabba Desil… 175 1358 &lt;NA&gt; green-… orange 600 herm… mascu… Nal Hu… ## 6 IG-88 200 140 none metal red 15 none mascu… &lt;NA&gt; ## 7 R4-P17 96 NA none silver… red, b… NA none femin… &lt;NA&gt; ## 8 Tarfful 234 136 brown brown blue NA male mascu… Kashyy… ## 9 BB8 NA NA none none black NA none mascu… &lt;NA&gt; ## # … with 4 more variables: species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, vehicles &lt;list&gt;, ## # starships &lt;list&gt;, and abbreviated variable names ¹​hair_color, ²​skin_color, ## # ³​eye_color, ⁴​birth_year, ⁵​homeworld Notice that the original starwars dataset is never modified by any of the filter functions. None of the dplyr functions modify the dataset passed to them with the data argument. Instead, they return a new data frame with the appropriate manipulations. 8.6 Arrange rows with arrange() arrange() reorders rows in the given data frame. It takes a data frame and a set of columns names to reorder by. If you give more than one column name, additional column names are used to break ties in the values of proceeding column names. starwars %&gt;% arrange(mass, height) ## # A tibble: 87 × 14 ## name height mass hair_…¹ skin_…² eye_c…³ birth…⁴ sex gender homew…⁵ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Ratts Tyer… 79 15 none grey, … unknown NA male mascu… Aleen … ## 2 Yoda 66 17 white green brown 896 male mascu… &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 Wicket Sys… 88 20 brown brown brown 8 male mascu… Endor ## 4 R2-D2 96 32 &lt;NA&gt; white,… red 33 none mascu… Naboo ## 5 R5-D4 97 32 &lt;NA&gt; white,… red NA none mascu… Tatooi… ## 6 Sebulba 112 40 none grey, … orange NA male mascu… Malast… ## 7 Dud Bolt 94 45 none blue, … yellow NA male mascu… Vulpter ## 8 Padmé Amid… 165 45 brown light brown 46 fema… femin… Naboo ## 9 Sly Moore 178 48 none pale white NA &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; Umbara ## 10 Wat Tambor 193 48 none green,… unknown NA male mascu… Skako ## # … with 77 more rows, 4 more variables: species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, ## # vehicles &lt;list&gt;, starships &lt;list&gt;, and abbreviated variable names ## # ¹​hair_color, ²​skin_color, ³​eye_color, ⁴​birth_year, ⁵​homeworld You can use desc() to order in descending order. starwars %&gt;% arrange(desc(mass)) ## # A tibble: 87 × 14 ## name height mass hair_…¹ skin_…² eye_c…³ birth…⁴ sex gender homew…⁵ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Jabba Desi… 175 1358 &lt;NA&gt; green-… orange 600 herm… mascu… Nal Hu… ## 2 Grievous 216 159 none brown,… green,… NA male mascu… Kalee ## 3 IG-88 200 140 none metal red 15 none mascu… &lt;NA&gt; ## 4 Darth Vader 202 136 none white yellow 41.9 male mascu… Tatooi… ## 5 Tarfful 234 136 brown brown blue NA male mascu… Kashyy… ## 6 Owen Lars 178 120 brown,… light blue 52 male mascu… Tatooi… ## 7 Bossk 190 113 none green red 53 male mascu… Trando… ## 8 Chewbacca 228 112 brown unknown blue 200 male mascu… Kashyy… ## 9 Jek Tono P… 180 110 brown fair blue NA male mascu… Bestin… ## 10 Dexter Jet… 198 102 none brown yellow NA male mascu… Ojom ## # … with 77 more rows, 4 more variables: species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, ## # vehicles &lt;list&gt;, starships &lt;list&gt;, and abbreviated variable names ## # ¹​hair_color, ²​skin_color, ³​eye_color, ⁴​birth_year, ⁵​homeworld 8.7 Choose rows using their position with slice() Use slice to choose rows by their position. For example, to choose the character in the second row of the data frame: starwars %&gt;% slice(2) ## # A tibble: 1 × 14 ## name height mass hair_color skin_color eye_co…¹ birth…² sex gender homew…³ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 C-3PO 167 75 &lt;NA&gt; gold yellow 112 none mascu… Tatooi… ## # … with 4 more variables: species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, vehicles &lt;list&gt;, ## # starships &lt;list&gt;, and abbreviated variable names ¹​eye_color, ²​birth_year, ## # ³​homeworld The first, tenth, and twentieth rows of the data frame, starwars %&gt;% slice(c(1,10,20)) ## # A tibble: 3 × 14 ## name height mass hair_…¹ skin_…² eye_c…³ birth…⁴ sex gender homew…⁵ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Luke Skywal… 172 77 blond fair blue 19 male mascu… Tatooi… ## 2 Obi-Wan Ken… 182 77 auburn… fair blue-g… 57 male mascu… Stewjon ## 3 Palpatine 170 75 grey pale yellow 82 male mascu… Naboo ## # … with 4 more variables: species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, vehicles &lt;list&gt;, ## # starships &lt;list&gt;, and abbreviated variable names ¹​hair_color, ²​skin_color, ## # ³​eye_color, ⁴​birth_year, ⁵​homeworld The odd rows of the data frame, starwars %&gt;% slice(seq(1,nrow(starwars), 2)) ## # A tibble: 44 × 14 ## name height mass hair_…¹ skin_…² eye_c…³ birth…⁴ sex gender homew…⁵ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Luke Skywa… 172 77 blond fair blue 19 male mascu… Tatooi… ## 2 R2-D2 96 32 &lt;NA&gt; white,… red 33 none mascu… Naboo ## 3 Leia Organa 150 49 brown light brown 19 fema… femin… Aldera… ## 4 Beru White… 165 75 brown light blue 47 fema… femin… Tatooi… ## 5 Biggs Dark… 183 84 black light brown 24 male mascu… Tatooi… ## 6 Anakin Sky… 188 84 blond fair blue 41.9 male mascu… Tatooi… ## 7 Chewbacca 228 112 brown unknown blue 200 male mascu… Kashyy… ## 8 Greedo 173 74 &lt;NA&gt; green black 44 male mascu… Rodia ## 9 Wedge Anti… 170 77 brown fair hazel 21 male mascu… Corell… ## 10 Yoda 66 17 white green brown 896 male mascu… &lt;NA&gt; ## # … with 34 more rows, 4 more variables: species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, ## # vehicles &lt;list&gt;, starships &lt;list&gt;, and abbreviated variable names ## # ¹​hair_color, ²​skin_color, ³​eye_color, ⁴​birth_year, ⁵​homeworld Combine with arrange() to quickly get the character with the largest height, starwars %&gt;% arrange(desc(height)) %&gt;% slice(1) ## # A tibble: 1 × 14 ## name height mass hair_c…¹ skin_…² eye_c…³ birth…⁴ sex gender homew…⁵ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Yarael Poof 264 NA none white yellow NA male mascu… Quermia ## # … with 4 more variables: species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, vehicles &lt;list&gt;, ## # starships &lt;list&gt;, and abbreviated variable names ¹​hair_color, ²​skin_color, ## # ³​eye_color, ⁴​birth_year, ⁵​homeworld There are a few convenient helper versions of the slice function: slice_head slice_tail slice_sample slice_min slice_max I’ll leave it to you to pull up the help page for those functions. 8.8 Select columns with select() When you’re working with large datasets, sometimes you want to drop all of the columns you’re not using or interested in. For example, if you only wanted the species column: starwars %&gt;% select(species) ## # A tibble: 87 × 1 ## species ## &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Human ## 2 Droid ## 3 Droid ## 4 Human ## 5 Human ## 6 Human ## 7 Human ## 8 Droid ## 9 Human ## 10 Human ## # … with 77 more rows Or, if you wanted name, species, and homeworld: starwars %&gt;% select(name, species, homeworld) ## # A tibble: 87 × 3 ## name species homeworld ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Luke Skywalker Human Tatooine ## 2 C-3PO Droid Tatooine ## 3 R2-D2 Droid Naboo ## 4 Darth Vader Human Tatooine ## 5 Leia Organa Human Alderaan ## 6 Owen Lars Human Tatooine ## 7 Beru Whitesun lars Human Tatooine ## 8 R5-D4 Droid Tatooine ## 9 Biggs Darklighter Human Tatooine ## 10 Obi-Wan Kenobi Human Stewjon ## # … with 77 more rows What if you wanted all columns with the letter m in the column name? starwars %&gt;% select(contains(&quot;m&quot;)) ## # A tibble: 87 × 4 ## name mass homeworld films ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;list&gt; ## 1 Luke Skywalker 77 Tatooine &lt;chr [5]&gt; ## 2 C-3PO 75 Tatooine &lt;chr [6]&gt; ## 3 R2-D2 32 Naboo &lt;chr [7]&gt; ## 4 Darth Vader 136 Tatooine &lt;chr [4]&gt; ## 5 Leia Organa 49 Alderaan &lt;chr [5]&gt; ## 6 Owen Lars 120 Tatooine &lt;chr [3]&gt; ## 7 Beru Whitesun lars 75 Tatooine &lt;chr [3]&gt; ## 8 R5-D4 32 Tatooine &lt;chr [1]&gt; ## 9 Biggs Darklighter 84 Tatooine &lt;chr [1]&gt; ## 10 Obi-Wan Kenobi 77 Stewjon &lt;chr [6]&gt; ## # … with 77 more rows See the tidyselect documentation for more selection helpers (like contains). 8.9 Rename columns with rename() rename() lets you rename columns. For example, if you wanted to rename the column “homeworld” to “home_world”: renamed_starwars &lt;- starwars %&gt;% rename(home_world=homeworld) colnames(starwars) ## [1] &quot;name&quot; &quot;height&quot; &quot;mass&quot; &quot;hair_color&quot; &quot;skin_color&quot; ## [6] &quot;eye_color&quot; &quot;birth_year&quot; &quot;sex&quot; &quot;gender&quot; &quot;homeworld&quot; ## [11] &quot;species&quot; &quot;films&quot; &quot;vehicles&quot; &quot;starships&quot; colnames(renamed_starwars) ## [1] &quot;name&quot; &quot;height&quot; &quot;mass&quot; &quot;hair_color&quot; &quot;skin_color&quot; ## [6] &quot;eye_color&quot; &quot;birth_year&quot; &quot;sex&quot; &quot;gender&quot; &quot;home_world&quot; ## [11] &quot;species&quot; &quot;films&quot; &quot;vehicles&quot; &quot;starships&quot; 8.10 Add new columns with mutate() Often, it is useful to add new columns that are functions of existing columns. For example, we could add a new column to each row that is the product of that row’s height and mass values. starwars_new_col &lt;- starwars %&gt;% mutate(heightXmass = height * mass) colnames(starwars_new_col) ## [1] &quot;name&quot; &quot;height&quot; &quot;mass&quot; &quot;hair_color&quot; &quot;skin_color&quot; ## [6] &quot;eye_color&quot; &quot;birth_year&quot; &quot;sex&quot; &quot;gender&quot; &quot;homeworld&quot; ## [11] &quot;species&quot; &quot;films&quot; &quot;vehicles&quot; &quot;starships&quot; &quot;heightXmass&quot; 8.11 Change column order with relocate() Relocate let’s you move columns around in your data set. For example, to move the name column after the height column, you can: starwars %&gt;% relocate(name, .after=height) ## # A tibble: 87 × 14 ## height name mass hair_…¹ skin_…² eye_c…³ birth…⁴ sex gender homew…⁵ ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 172 Luke Skywa… 77 blond fair blue 19 male mascu… Tatooi… ## 2 167 C-3PO 75 &lt;NA&gt; gold yellow 112 none mascu… Tatooi… ## 3 96 R2-D2 32 &lt;NA&gt; white,… red 33 none mascu… Naboo ## 4 202 Darth Vader 136 none white yellow 41.9 male mascu… Tatooi… ## 5 150 Leia Organa 49 brown light brown 19 fema… femin… Aldera… ## 6 178 Owen Lars 120 brown,… light blue 52 male mascu… Tatooi… ## 7 165 Beru White… 75 brown light blue 47 fema… femin… Tatooi… ## 8 97 R5-D4 32 &lt;NA&gt; white,… red NA none mascu… Tatooi… ## 9 183 Biggs Dark… 84 black light brown 24 male mascu… Tatooi… ## 10 182 Obi-Wan Ke… 77 auburn… fair blue-g… 57 male mascu… Stewjon ## # … with 77 more rows, 4 more variables: species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, ## # vehicles &lt;list&gt;, starships &lt;list&gt;, and abbreviated variable names ## # ¹​hair_color, ²​skin_color, ³​eye_color, ⁴​birth_year, ⁵​homeworld 8.12 Summarize groups of rows using summarise() summarise() collapses a dataset into a single row. starwars %&gt;% summarise(mass = mean(mass, na.rm=TRUE)) ## # A tibble: 1 × 1 ## mass ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 97.3 summarise() is particularly useful in combination with the group_by function. For example, to get the average mass of characters in each species, starwars %&gt;% group_by(species) %&gt;% summarise(mass=mean(mass, na.rm=TRUE)) ## # A tibble: 38 × 2 ## species mass ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Aleena 15 ## 2 Besalisk 102 ## 3 Cerean 82 ## 4 Chagrian NaN ## 5 Clawdite 55 ## 6 Droid 69.8 ## 7 Dug 40 ## 8 Ewok 20 ## 9 Geonosian 80 ## 10 Gungan 74 ## # … with 28 more rows Or, if we wanted to count the number of characters of each species, starwars %&gt;% group_by(species) %&gt;% summarise(count=n()) ## # A tibble: 38 × 2 ## species count ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Aleena 1 ## 2 Besalisk 1 ## 3 Cerean 1 ## 4 Chagrian 1 ## 5 Clawdite 1 ## 6 Droid 6 ## 7 Dug 1 ## 8 Ewok 1 ## 9 Geonosian 1 ## 10 Gungan 3 ## # … with 28 more rows 8.13 dplyr cheat sheet Download pdf here: https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-transformation.pdf "],["using-tidyr-to-create-tidy-data.html", "Chapter 9 Using tidyr to create tidy data 9.1 Setup 9.2 Overview 9.3 What is tidy data? 9.4 Making data tidy", " Chapter 9 Using tidyr to create tidy data You can download the R Markdown file used to generate this document (or webpage) here. I would encourage you to download that Rmd file, open it own your own computer in RStudio, and run the code chunks on your own (and modify things as you wish!). Goals: Work through examples of using tidyr (and dplyr) functions to clean up messy (un-tidy) data Sources: https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html R for Data Science 9.1 Setup You should have already installed the tidyverse collection of packages, which includes the tidyr package. But, if you haven’t, go ahead and run: install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) In this document, we’ll be using the tidyr and dplyr packages. library(tidyr) library(dplyr) 9.2 Overview If you have not already, I suggest that you read the following article for an introduction to tidy data: https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html. Additionally, I suggest that you work through the dplyr R Markdown material before working through this document. The tidyr package provides functions for making messy data “tidy”. For a complete list of the included functions, see https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html. Understanding tidy data and how to reformat your data into a tidy format is very important, as many of the functions/packages that we will use this semester are written to work with tidy-format data. For example, ggplot (the R graphics package that we will be using) assumes tidy data. Taking the time now to get comfortable with what it means to have tidy data will save you substantial time later on. 9.3 What is tidy data? You can represent the same underlying data many ways. For example, let’s say we have the following data about students’ grades: messy_grade_data1 &lt;- read.csv(&quot;lecture-material/week-02/data/messy_grades_1.csv&quot;, na.strings=&quot;&quot;) messy_grade_data1 ## name quiz1 quiz2 test1 ## 1 Billy &lt;NA&gt; D C ## 2 Suzy F &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 Lionel B C B ## 4 Jenny A A B Or, the same exact data could be structured as follows: messy_grade_data2 &lt;- read.csv(&quot;lecture-material/week-02/data/messy_grades_2.csv&quot;, na.strings=&quot;&quot;) messy_grade_data2 ## assessment Billy Suzy Lionel Jenny ## 1 quiz1 &lt;NA&gt; FALSE B A ## 2 quiz2 D NA C A ## 3 test1 C NA B B Neither of these formats are particularly convenient to work with. For example, in messy_grade_data2 format, it would be difficult to query the full set of student names in the dataset (because each student has their own column). Likewise, in messy_grade_data1, it would be diffult to query the set of assessments. From https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html, A dataset is a collection of values, usually either numbers (if quantitative) or strings (if qualitative). Values are organised in two ways. Every value belongs to a variable and an observation. A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute (like height, temperature, duration) across units. An observation contains all values measured on the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a race) across attributes. A tidy version of the grade data would look something like this: tidy_grade_data &lt;- messy_grade_data1 %&gt;% pivot_longer(c(quiz1,quiz2,test1), names_to=&quot;assessment&quot;, values_to=&quot;grade&quot;) tidy_grade_data ## # A tibble: 12 × 3 ## name assessment grade ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Billy quiz1 &lt;NA&gt; ## 2 Billy quiz2 D ## 3 Billy test1 C ## 4 Suzy quiz1 F ## 5 Suzy quiz2 &lt;NA&gt; ## 6 Suzy test1 &lt;NA&gt; ## 7 Lionel quiz1 B ## 8 Lionel quiz2 C ## 9 Lionel test1 B ## 10 Jenny quiz1 A ## 11 Jenny quiz2 A ## 12 Jenny test1 B This arrangement makes the values, variables, and observations clearer. What are the values, variables, and observations in the grade data? (the answer is here). A dataset is tidy if: Each variable has its own column Each observation has its own row Each value has its own cell In the grade data, we have the following variables: student name, assessment, and grade. Each observation is a particular student’s grade on a particular assessment (e.g., Jenny’s grade on test1). Each cell in the dataset specifies a value for a particular variable (e.g., in row 1 of tidy_grade_data, Billy is the value of the name variable). 9.4 Making data tidy Two common ways that data is messy: Column headers are values, not variable names Multiple variables are stored in one column For more common ways that data are often messy, see: https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html#tidying Below, are datasets that exemplify each problem. 9.4.1 Column headers are values, not variables Observations over time are often recorded in a “wide” format. That is, each timepoint that an observation is made is entered as a column. This is convienient for data entry. For example, imagine you measure the temperature of a lake at several different depths over a 10 week period (one measurement for each depth every week). It’s convenient to enter that data in a “wide” format where each week is a column. However, this is not tidy, as each row is no longer a single observation. The billboard dataset that is loaded when you load the tidyr package is exemplifies this problem. billboard ## # A tibble: 317 × 79 ## artist track date.ent…¹ wk1 wk2 wk3 wk4 wk5 wk6 wk7 wk8 wk9 ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2 Pac Baby… 2000-02-26 87 82 72 77 87 94 99 NA NA ## 2 2Ge+h… The … 2000-09-02 91 87 92 NA NA NA NA NA NA ## 3 3 Doo… Kryp… 2000-04-08 81 70 68 67 66 57 54 53 51 ## 4 3 Doo… Loser 2000-10-21 76 76 72 69 67 65 55 59 62 ## 5 504 B… Wobb… 2000-04-15 57 34 25 17 17 31 36 49 53 ## 6 98^0 Give… 2000-08-19 51 39 34 26 26 19 2 2 3 ## 7 A*Tee… Danc… 2000-07-08 97 97 96 95 100 NA NA NA NA ## 8 Aaliy… I Do… 2000-01-29 84 62 51 41 38 35 35 38 38 ## 9 Aaliy… Try … 2000-03-18 59 53 38 28 21 18 16 14 12 ## 10 Adams… Open… 2000-08-26 76 76 74 69 68 67 61 58 57 ## # … with 307 more rows, 67 more variables: wk10 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk11 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk12 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # wk13 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk14 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk15 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk16 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk17 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk18 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # wk19 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk20 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk21 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk22 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk23 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk24 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # wk25 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk26 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk27 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk28 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk29 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk30 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # wk31 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk32 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk33 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk34 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk35 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk36 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # wk37 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk38 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk39 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk40 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk41 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk42 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # wk43 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk44 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk45 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk46 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk47 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk48 &lt;dbl&gt;, … The billboard dataset records the date a song enters the billboard top 100. First on your own, use the pivot_longer function to create a tidy version of the billboard dataset. The solution can be found here. 9.4.2 Multiple variables are stored in one column Sometimes, the values in a column describe multiple variables. For example, in the following messy dataset, the month and day of each temperature recording are combined under a single column. messy_temperature &lt;- read.csv(&quot;lecture-material/week-02/data/multi_variables_single_col.csv&quot;) messy_temperature ## date year temperature ## 1 jan1 2022 15 ## 2 jan14 2022 130 ## 3 feb1 2022 19 ## 4 feb14 2022 85 ## 5 mar1 2022 95 ## 6 mar14 2022 130 ## 7 apr1 2022 29 ## 8 apr14 2022 42 ## 9 may1 2022 138 ## 10 may14 2022 14 ## 11 jun1 2022 133 ## 12 jun14 2022 53 ## 13 jul1 2022 120 ## 14 jul14 2022 108 ## 15 aug1 2022 23 ## 16 aug14 2022 148 ## 17 sep1 2022 103 ## 18 sep14 2022 113 ## 19 nov1 2022 67 ## 20 nov14 2022 1 ## 21 oct1 2022 113 ## 22 oct14 2022 56 ## 23 dec1 2022 107 ## 24 dec14 2022 30 The first three characters of the “date” column give the month, and the following numeric value gives the day of the month of the temperature reading. We can use the separate function to properly split the date column into multiple columns. tidy_temperature &lt;- messy_temperature %&gt;% separate(col=date, into=c(&quot;month&quot;,&quot;day&quot;), sep=3) tidy_temperature ## month day year temperature ## 1 jan 1 2022 15 ## 2 jan 14 2022 130 ## 3 feb 1 2022 19 ## 4 feb 14 2022 85 ## 5 mar 1 2022 95 ## 6 mar 14 2022 130 ## 7 apr 1 2022 29 ## 8 apr 14 2022 42 ## 9 may 1 2022 138 ## 10 may 14 2022 14 ## 11 jun 1 2022 133 ## 12 jun 14 2022 53 ## 13 jul 1 2022 120 ## 14 jul 14 2022 108 ## 15 aug 1 2022 23 ## 16 aug 14 2022 148 ## 17 sep 1 2022 103 ## 18 sep 14 2022 113 ## 19 nov 1 2022 67 ## 20 nov 14 2022 1 ## 21 oct 1 2022 113 ## 22 oct 14 2022 56 ## 23 dec 1 2022 107 ## 24 dec 14 2022 30 Run ?separate to see how the separate function works. Adding extra columns doesn’t “untidy” your data. Sometimes it is useful to add additional aggregate labels to an observation (especially when working with dates). For example, it might be useful to add a proper date column (with the format YEAR-MONTH-DAY) to our tidied temperature data. I’ll leave that as an exercise for you to do on your own. You’ll need to map each month string to its numeric representation (e.g. jan = 1, feb = 2). Then you can use mutate to create a new column from the relevant columns.

This will be our “ground truth” signal. Next, we’ll simulate different types of noise that could result from imperfect measurements. Finally, we’ll apply 2 basic denoising techniques to each of our noisy signals. 13.1 Generating the ground truth For this demonstration, we’ll generate a signal that behaves like a sine wave. Feel free to adjust any of the parameters to see how it influences our ability to denoise the signal. # Resolution gives the number of measurements in our signal. resolution &lt;- 1000 # x_range_min gives the minimum x value in our signal. x_range_min &lt;- 0 # x_range_max gives the maximum x value in our signal. x_range_max &lt;- (8 * pi) # Generate our signal x,y: x &lt;- (seq(from=x_range_min, to=resolution) / resolution) * x_range_max y &lt;- sin(x) # Create a data frame data &lt;- data.frame(x=x, y_true=y) data$y_true gives the ground truth signal. We can graph our ground truth: ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y_true)) + geom_point() + labs( x = &quot;X&quot;, y = &quot;True value&quot;, title = &quot;Ground truth&quot; ) 13.2 Adding some noise First, let’s simulate that we had a noisy sensor such that each measurement has a small amount of random noise. To do so, we’ll add a little bit of Gaussian noise to our ground truth signal. # noise_sd controls the level of noise applied to each measurement noise_sd &lt;- 0.1 data$y_noise &lt;- data$y + rnorm(length(data$y), 0, 0.1) We can graph this noisy signal: ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y_noise)) + geom_point() + labs( x = &quot;X&quot;, y = &quot;Noisy measurement value&quot; ) Next, let’s add another kind of noise that we might encounter with our sensor. What if our sensor randomly fails, returning a nonsense value (in this case, let’s say 99). prob_sensor_failure &lt;- 0.02 # Sensor fails 2% of the time failure_value &lt;- 99 # &quot;Simulate&quot; when our sensor fails. Use rbinom to flip a biased coin for each object in our data. data$sensor_failure &lt;- rbinom(nrow(data), 1, prob_sensor_failure) data$y_noise_faulty &lt;- mapply( function(y, fail) { if (fail) { return(failure_value) } else { return (y) } }, data$y_noise, data$sensor_failure ) Graph our faulty sensor data. ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y_noise_faulty)) + geom_point() + labs( x = &quot;X&quot;, y = &quot;Faulty measurement value&quot; ) We have our nice signal, and then we have those sensor failure measurements throwing everything off. 13.3 Denoising using a rolling average Let’s try denoising using a rolling average. This technique loops over each value in your sequence, setting that value to the average of its neighbors. The number of neighbors is determined by the “window size”. # This function calculates a rolling average over the sequence parameter. # window_width defines how far the window extends to either side of the each index. rolling_avg &lt;- function(sequence, window_width=1) { avgs &lt;- c() for (i in seq_along(sequence)) { window &lt;- c(i) for (w_i in 1:window_width) { left &lt;- i - w_i right &lt;- i + w_i # Check that our window doesn&#39;t walk off the edge of our sequence. # If so, extend the other side of the window. if (left &lt; 1) { left &lt;- (i + window_width) + (abs(1 - left)) } if (right &gt; length(sequence)) { right &lt;- (i - window_width) - ((right - length(sequence)) ) } window &lt;- c(window, left) window &lt;- c(window, right) } avgs &lt;- c(avgs, mean( sequence[window] )) } return(avgs) } Apply our rolling average function to y_noise window_w &lt;- 10 data$y_noise_denoised &lt;- rolling_avg( data$y_noise, window_width=window_w ) ggplot(data, aes(x=x, y=y_noise_denoised)) + geom_point() Much smoother! The rolling average works well when you want to smooth out a small magnitude of random noise. Apply our rolling average function to y_noise_faulty: window_w &lt;- 10 data$y_noise_faulty_denoised &lt;- rolling_avg( data$y_noise_faulty, window_width=window_w ) ggplot(data, aes(x=x, y=y_noise_faulty_denoised)) + geom_point() Yikes! Our signal looks worse than it did before we applied the rolling average denoising. 13.3.1 Exercises Generate a small sequence of 10 random values. On paper, apply a rolling average filter to your sequence. You decide the window size. What would happen if you increased your window size? What about if you decreased your window size? Is the rolling average a good denoising approach for y_noise? What about y_noise_faulty? Did the rolling average improve how representative y_noise_faulty is of the ground truth signal? Try calculating the mean squared error for each of y_noise and y_noise_denoised. Does error go down? What about for y_noise_faulty and y_noise_faulty_denoised? What happens when you make the rolling average window smaller? Bigger? What happens when you add more noise to the signal? Identify any lines of code that you don’t understand. Use the documentation to figure out what those lines of code are doing. 13.4 Denoising using a median filter A median filter is similar to applying a rolling average, except instead of replacing each value in our sequence with the average of its neighbors, we replace it with the median of its neighbors. # This function calculates a rolling average over the sequence parameter. # window_width defines how far the window extends to either side of the each index. median_filter &lt;- function(sequence, window_width=1) { avgs &lt;- c() for (i in seq_along(sequence)) { window &lt;- c(i) for (w_i in 1:window_width) { left &lt;- i - w_i right &lt;- i + w_i # Check that our window doesn&#39;t walk off the edge of our sequence. # If so, extend the other side of the window. if (left &lt; 1) { left &lt;- (i + window_width) + (abs(1 - left)) } if (right &gt; length(sequence)) { right &lt;- (i - window_width) - ((right - length(sequence)) ) } window &lt;- c(window, left) window &lt;- c(window, right) } avgs &lt;- c(avgs, median( sequence[window] )) } return(avgs) } Apply our rolling average function to y_noise: window_w &lt;- 10 data$y_noise_denoised &lt;- median_filter( data$y_noise, window_width=window_w ) ggplot(data, aes(x=x, y=y_noise_denoised)) + geom_point() Apply our rolling average function to y_noise_faulty: window_w &lt;- 10 data$y_noise_faulty_denoised &lt;- median_filter( data$y_noise_faulty, window_width=window_w ) ggplot(data, aes(x=x, y=y_noise_faulty_denoised)) + geom_point() 13.4.1 Exercises Do you notice any differences in the results of applying a median filter versus applying a rolling average? Generate a small sequence of 10 random values. On paper, apply a median filter to your sequence. You decide the window size. What happens if you increase your window size? What about if you decrease your window size? Is the median filter a good denoising approach for y_noise? What about y_noise_faulty? Try calculating the mean squared error for each of y_noise and y_noise_denoised. Does error go down? What about for y_noise_faulty and y_noise_faulty_denoised? Did the median filter improve how representative y_noise_faulty is of the ground truth signal? What happens when you make the median filter window smaller? Bigger? What happens when you add more noise to the signal? Identify any lines of code that you don’t understand. Use the documentation to figure out what those lines of code are doing. 13.5 Further exploration As we talked about in class, the appropriate-ness of different denoising techniques will depend on your data and your particular application domain. The R community has implemented many denoising techniques. For example, the signal package includes many signal denoising functions.

There are many methods of dealing with missing values in a dataset. Here, we’ll cover how to apply a few simple/basic approaches in R: Feature elimination (remove columns with missing values) Object elimination (remove rows with missing values) Mean imputation Median imputation This activity is meant to server as a “how to” guide and does not discuss when different methods of handling missing values should be applied. Whether or not a particular approach is appropriate will depend on your particular dataset and domain. 14.1 Dependencies and setup We’ll need to load the tidyverse packages for this lab activity: library(tidyverse) 14.2 Testing for missing values In R, missing values are often represented by NA (or some other value particular to your data; e.g., -1, none, etc). You can identify missing values using is.na() (run ?is.na to see documentation). In this demo, we’ll play with the airquality dataset, which comes loaded automatically in R. head(airquality) ## Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day ## 1 41 190 7.4 67 5 1 ## 2 36 118 8.0 72 5 2 ## 3 12 149 12.6 74 5 3 ## 4 18 313 11.5 62 5 4 ## 5 NA NA 14.3 56 5 5 ## 6 28 NA 14.9 66 5 6 There are NA values in the airquality dataset. To get a binary dataframe that indicates which positions have NA values, you can: airquality_na &lt;- is.na(airquality) head(airquality_na) ## Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day ## [1,] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [2,] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [3,] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [4,] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [5,] TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [6,] FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE 14.3 Dropping columns with missing values (feature elimination) First, let’s get a list of columns that contain missing values. columns_with_na &lt;- c() for (col in colnames(airquality)) { if (NA %in% airquality[,col]) { columns_with_na &lt;- c(columns_with_na, col) } } print(columns_with_na) ## [1] &quot;Ozone&quot; &quot;Solar.R&quot; You can verify that against the airquality_na matrix we created earlier. To drop columns, we can use the select function in dplyr. dropped_cols_data &lt;- airquality %&gt;% select( !all_of(columns_with_na) ) head(dropped_cols_data) ## Wind Temp Month Day ## 1 7.4 67 5 1 ## 2 8.0 72 5 2 ## 3 12.6 74 5 3 ## 4 11.5 62 5 4 ## 5 14.3 56 5 5 ## 6 14.9 66 5 6 14.4 Dropping rows with missing values (object elimination) If you know exactly what columns have missing values in them, you can use filter to filter out rows where those columns have NA. dropped_rows_data &lt;- airquality %&gt;% filter( !(is.na(Ozone) | is.na(Solar.R)) ) head(dropped_rows_data) ## Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day ## 1 41 190 7.4 67 5 1 ## 2 36 118 8.0 72 5 2 ## 3 12 149 12.6 74 5 3 ## 4 18 313 11.5 62 5 4 ## 5 23 299 8.6 65 5 7 ## 6 19 99 13.8 59 5 8 A little bit more generic, we can use the matrix we generated earlier, airquality_na. # First, let&#39;s figure out all of the row ids that we want to drop drop_rows &lt;- c() for (ri in 1:nrow(airquality_na)) { if (TRUE %in% as.vector(airquality_na[ri,])) { drop_rows &lt;- c(drop_rows, ri) } } # We can use filter to drop all of the row ids in drop_rows dropped_rows_data2 &lt;- airquality %&gt;% filter( !(row_number() %in% drop_rows) ) head(dropped_rows_data2) ## Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day ## 1 41 190 7.4 67 5 1 ## 2 36 118 8.0 72 5 2 ## 3 12 149 12.6 74 5 3 ## 4 18 313 11.5 62 5 4 ## 5 23 299 8.6 65 5 7 ## 6 19 99 13.8 59 5 8 14.5 Mean imputation A mean imputation replaces missing values for a particular feature with the mean of other values for that feature.

What does it mean for one object (i.e., row) to be “near” another object? How could you quantify how close two objects are to one another? How would you implement this approach in R? (either from scratch or using an existing function in a library you install/load) Assume that you have a dataset where each object has two features: a continuous feature (where some of the values are missing) and a categorical feature. In this dataset, objects of the same category are more similar to each other than to objects in different categories. You want to apply a mean imputation to this dataset to replace the missing values in the continuous feature. How could you use each object’s category to improve your mean imputation?

What are some ways that our random sample might not be representative of our larger data set (starwars)? For example, we can look at the distribution of homeworlds in our original data. # Get the distribution of homeworlds in full dataset. orig_homeworlds &lt;- starwars %&gt;% group_by( homeworld ) %&gt;% summarise( n=n() ) %&gt;% mutate( freq = n / sum(n), ) %&gt;% arrange( desc(freq) ) # Get the distribution of homeworlds in the sampled dataset. sampled_homeworlds &lt;- naive_sampled_data %&gt;% group_by( homeworld ) %&gt;% summarise( n=n() ) %&gt;% mutate( freq = n / sum(n), ) %&gt;% arrange( desc(freq) ) Let’s take a look at the distribution of homeworlds from the original dataset: ggplot( orig_homeworlds, aes( x=reorder(homeworld, -freq), y=freq ) ) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) + labs( x=&quot;Homeworld&quot;, y=&quot;Frequency&quot;, title=&quot;Distribution of homeworlds for original dataset&quot; ) + theme( axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45, hjust=1) ) And now the sampled dataset: ggplot( sampled_homeworlds, aes( x=reorder(homeworld, -freq), y=freq ) ) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) + labs( x=&quot;Homeworld&quot;, y=&quot;Frequency&quot;, title=&quot;Distribution of homeworlds for sampled dataset&quot; ) + theme( axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45, hjust=1) ) 15.2.1 Exercises What differences do you notice between the distribution of homeworlds in the original dataset and the sampled dataset? How could you modify slice_sample to randomly sample, but instead of weighting all rows equally, you weight each row’s likelihood of being included in the sample according to the height attribute? Hint: ?slice_sample Adjust the sample proportion parameter and resample. What happens to the distribution of species as you increase or decrease the sample size? Read the R code. Identify any lines of code that you don’t understand. Use the documentation to figure out what those lines of code are doing. 15.3 Stratified random sampling Stratified sampling can be used in cases where there are predefined groupings of objects. In stratified sampling, you enforce the level of representation for each group. For example, we might want to ensure that each species among Star Wars characters is represented in our sample. There are many ways to implement this, and the particular approach you take will depend on your objective. In this example, I’ll randomly sample each species independently, guaranteeing that at least one character of each species is represented in our sample. # Grab the set of species represented in our original dataset species &lt;- levels(as.factor(starwars$species)) # Create an empty data frame that we will store our sample stratified_sampled_data &lt;- data.frame( matrix( ncol=ncol(starwars), nrow=0, dimnames=list(NULL,colnames(starwars)) ) ) for (s in species) { # First, filter down to the species species_sample &lt;- starwars %&gt;% filter( species==s ) # Calculate sample size, guarantee &gt;= 1 sample_size = max( ceiling(nrow(species_sample)*sample_proportion), 1 ) # Sample from characters of the current species species_sample &lt;- species_sample %&gt;% slice_sample( n=sample_size, replace=FALSE ) # Add sample of this species to larger sample stratified_sampled_data &lt;- rbind( stratified_sampled_data, species_sample ) } stratified_sampled_data ## # A tibble: 44 × 14 ## name height mass hair_…¹ skin_…² eye_c…³ birth…⁴ sex gender homew…⁵ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Ratts Tyer… 79 15 none grey, … unknown NA male mascu… Aleen … ## 2 Dexter Jet… 198 102 none brown yellow NA male mascu… Ojom ## 3 Ki-Adi-Mun… 198 82 white pale yellow 92 male mascu… Cerea ## 4 Mas Amedda 196 NA none blue blue NA male mascu… Champa… ## 5 Zam Wesell 168 55 blonde fair, … yellow NA fema… femin… Zolan ## 6 R4-P17 96 NA none silver… red, b… NA none femin… &lt;NA&gt; ## 7 IG-88 200 140 none metal red 15 none mascu… &lt;NA&gt; ## 8 Sebulba 112 40 none grey, … orange NA male mascu… Malast… ## 9 Wicket Sys… 88 20 brown brown brown 8 male mascu… Endor ## 10 Poggle the… 183 80 none green yellow NA male mascu… Geonos… ## # … with 34 more rows, 4 more variables: species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, ## # vehicles &lt;list&gt;, starships &lt;list&gt;, and abbreviated variable names ## # ¹​hair_color, ²​skin_color, ³​eye_color, ⁴​birth_year, ⁵​homeworld 15.3.1 Exercises Graph the distribution of species in the original starwars dataset and in the stratified sample (just like we did for homeworlds in the naive random sample). What differences do you notice? What might be causing those differences? We specified a sample proportion of 0.2. Why might the size of our stratified sample differ from the size of our random sample? Read the R code. Identify any lines of code that you don’t understand. Use the documentation to figure out what those lines of code are doing. "],["curse-of-dimensionality-demo.html", "Chapter 16 Curse of dimensionality demo 16.1 Dependencies 16.2 Generate example data 16.3 Exercises", " Chapter 16 Curse of dimensionality demo As the dimensionality of your data increases, your data become increasingly sparse in the space that they occupy. As a result, the distances between objects in your dataset become less meaningful as dimensionality increases. This dynamic can make some data mining techniques less effective (e.g., clustering or outlier detection). In this activity, we will demonstrate the effect of dimensionality on distances in data. 16.1 Dependencies We’ll use the rdist package to calculate distances between points.

That is, we wanted to learn more about the properties of our senators dataset instead of building a model to predict the approval rating of unknown senators. As such, we did not create an explicit training and testing set. In essence, the entire senator dataset is our “training set”.

Use the documentation to figure out what is going on. Describe the decision tree. What is the most informative attribute for determining whether or not a senator has voter approval? How would you describe the performance of our model? What is its training error? Try adjusting the attributes for the Mystery Senator we created. What attributes can you change to change our model’s prediction? Identify a dataset that might be interesting to build a decision tree model for. Load that dataset into R Partition the data into a training and testing set (i.e., split the rows) Use rpart to build a decision tree using the training set.

You will propose and implement a data mining project in an application domain of your choice. You will be guided on your project through a series of check-in assignments (listed below), culminating in a written final report.

However, we have overviewed broad categories of data mining tasks. My advice is to start by choosing a domain that is interesting to you and a type of data mining task that you think is applicable (and that you are interested in learning more about). You will then need to do your own research on the specifics. Some example types of projects (your project does not need to fall under any of these categories) Solve a problem E.g., Design and apply a data mining pipeline to a particular problem you are interested in, and then evaluate your approach by comparing to another method. Replicate (and/or extend) a published study E.g., identify a published study that you are interested in and independently replicate some portion of it (you must create your own pipeline to do so, not just reuse the original authors’). Answer a research question E.g., formulate a hypothesis and design (and apply) a data mining approach to test your hypothesis. Analysis E.g., design a data mining pipeline for some task (or use an existing pipeline) and analyze how/why it works (or doesn’t work). You might try swapping out individual components of the pipeline for alternative techniques, add noise to the dataset, etc, etc. E.g., design an experiment to analyze the properties of different similarity metrics and their effect on a data mining algorithm You are welcome to drop by office hours to chat about project ideas!

The particular application area, techniques you choose to use, and the outputs of your project are open-ended and up to you to propose. Be creative! However, I do have the following expectations for all projects: I expect you to design and implement a complete data mining pipeline from start to finish. I expect your project to be well-researched, appropriate, and achievable in the given time frame. If you’re unsure, come chat with me during office hours! You may use existing software/libraries to implement your pipeline. However, you must implement at least one component (i.e., data collection, data mining algorithm) of your project yourself. For example, if your project involves extensive data preprocessing and then the use of symbolic regression to build a model that you plan to compare to an alternative approach, you may choose to implement your symbolic regression algorithm and use existing libraries for your data preprocessing and for the alternative model. I expect you to either collect your own dataset or use a publicly available dataset. I expect you to evaluate your data mining approach in some way. For example, conducting a small study that compares your approach to an alternative approach, assessing the accuracy of your model by holding back validation data, accessing the robustness of your model, etc. I expect you to effectively communicate your methodology and findings in a final report. This will take the form of a well-organized and well-written explanations with publication-quality visualzations. I will consider the overall difficulty of your project when determining whether or not it is sufficient (or infeasible) for your final project. For example, if your are collecting your own data, your pipeline will need to be simpler because of the extra time and effort requried for data collection. 21.2 Proposal guidelines Your project proposal should be under 3 pages, be formatted under the following headings, and address each of the following points: Project overview Provide an overview of your project. What is the application domain you are working on? What specific problem are you working on? Briefly, what is your overall approach? Why? What is your motivation? What are your goals for this project? Related work What similar projects have been attempted in your proposed domain? How do they related to your project? Data plan What data do you plan to use for your project? If you plan on collecting your own data, how do you plan to do so? If you plan to use an existing dataset, which dataset do you plan to use and why? Who collected your data and for what original purpose? What proprocessing do you expect to need to perform on your data? Implementation plan Describe your proposed data mining pipeline How will you implement your data mining pipeline? What major component do you plan to implement yourself? What components do you plan to use existing software/libraries for? Which software/libraries do you plan to use? Evaluation plan How do you plan to evaluate your data mining algorithm? Provide a broad overview of how you plan to evaluate your approach. How will you measure success? Will you compare to an alternative method? Measure accuracy with a ground truth testing set? Plan for group collaboration What is your plan for collaborating as a group? Do you plan to meet regularly in-person, over zoom, or coordinate asynchronously on a messaging application like discord? How do you plan to collaboratively implement your data mining pipeline? How will you manage your code and your data? Timeline Outline your week-by-week goals for completing your project by 11/30 Feel free to communicate this timeline as a bulleted list, a table, etc. References List your references. Include a project title and the members of your group as part of your proposal. Your proposal should be organized into clearly labeled sections (one to address each of the eight categories above). Each section should be written in paragraph form (with the exception of the references and the timeline section where you may opt to use a list or a table). Your proposal will be graded on the quality of your writing as well as your answers to the previously listed prompts. It should be evident that your group has thoroughly researched the area and formulated a plan to achieve your goals. I recognize that things may change during the course of the project, but I’m looking here to make sure you have a solid initial plan. Any significant project like this requires significant prework before implementation. 21.3 Grading The proposal will be graded as follows (out of 100): Item Points Project overview section addresses required points 10 Related work section addresses required points 15 Data plan section addresses required points 10 Implementation plan section addresses required points 15 Evaluation plan section addresses required points 10 Plan for group collaboration section addresses required points 10 Timeline section addresses required points 10 Related work and references are included and cited appropriately 5 Writing is appropriately formal 5 Writing is clear 5 Proposal is well-formatted 5 I reserve the right to award flex points for exemplary work in any areas of this project. "],["final-project---mid-project-update.html", "Chapter 22 Final project - Mid-project update 22.1 Requirements 22.2 Grading", " Chapter 22 Final project - Mid-project update The goal of this progress report is for you to have space to reflect on your progress so far and plan. You should be working on your final project consistently instead of leaving everything to the end of the semester. The progress report is a mechanism to make that more likely. You should not wait for my feedback on your progress update before resuming work on your project 🙂 22.1 Requirements Your progress update should be approximately one to two pages of text and address the following: Progress so far What have you completed so far? Provide a link to your data so far Provide a link to your code so far (e.g., github repository, etc) Challenges Have you run into any challenges so far? Has anything taken longer than expected? How have you overcome these challenges? If there are any current challenges you have not yet overcome, how do you plan to overcome them? Collaboration (if applicable) How frequently does your group meet? Does everyone feel like each group member is contributing meaningfully to the project? If not, how does your group plan address this problem? Next steps What do you still need to complete for your project? What is your plan to complete your project? Do you forsee any potential challenges? Organize your progress report into three sections (one for each of the categories above). 22.2 Grading Graded on the following out of 100: Item Points Addressed the required points 80 Document is clearly organized 10 Writing is sufficiently formal and clear 10 "],["final-project---report-draft.html", "Chapter 23 Final project - Report draft 23.1 Grading", " Chapter 23 Final project - Report draft This draft of your report is your opportunity to get my feedback on your report. Your draft does not need to be complete. I will give you feedback on it regardless of the state you turn it in (though, it does need to be well organized with proper section headings to facilitate me being able to give feedback). The more complete of a report you turn in, the more detailed feedback I can give you for what you need to do in order to earn the grade you want on your final report. For example, if you turn in a complete draft of your final report, I can tell you what grade you would receive if you turned it in as your final report and tell you where improvements can/need to be made. If your project is not complete by the time you turn in your draft, you should not wait for my feedback on your draft before resuming work on your project 🙂 23.1 Grading Your draft will be graded primarily on Effort: turned it in on time, draft contains meaningful content relevant to your final report, and it is clear that you have completed a meaningful amount of your project I can’t give meaningful feedback if you don’t submit a meaningful draft. I cannot give full credit for effort if you do not demonstrate that you have at least completed some meaningful portion of your project. Organization: clearly organized with proper section headings, text is readable I can’t give you useful feedback if your draft is not organized in a reasonable way. Graded on the following out of 100: Item Points Effort 80 Document is clearly organized 20 "],["final-project---final-report.html", "Chapter 24 Final project - Final report 24.1 Format 24.2 Contents 24.3 Deliverables 24.4 Grading", " Chapter 24 Final project - Final report Documenting your work is as important as building your data mining pipeline and generating results. If you don’t document your pipeline and your results and present them in an easily understood format, no one will ever know what you found! 24.1 Format Your final report can be prepared in a format of your choice. However, it must be clearly organized, use consistent formatting for citations/references, contain the required contents (see below), and I must be able to access it. To be safe, I would advise you to check with me before moving forward with a format. I cannot grade your report if I cannot access it. It is your responsibility to make sure that I can access it before you submit. (don’t rely on me to answer my email after 5:00pm on the day your assignment is due 😉) Example formats you might choose to compose your report in: Using R markdown to create a web-accessible HTML page. This could support interactivity and allow you to embed code into your report. Using R markdown and Bookdown to create an eBook. This could support interactivity and allow you to embed code into your report. Using LaTex to create a PDF If you use LaTex, I suggest using Overleaf–it’s like google docs, but for LaTex. Using a conventional text editor to create a PDF If you plan to use this project in a larger portfolio to send to potential employers, I strongly recommend making your report into a well-formatted (and interactive if possible) web page. I am happy to explain how to do so if you are interested. 24.2 Contents Your report should include the following sections: Introduction Related work Methods Results and Discussion Conclusion Data and Software Availability References You can (and probably should) include subsections within those sections. You may also embed code and its output directly into your document (e.g., as you would if using R markdown). If you want to deviate from this structure for some reason, you need to speak with me ahead of time (at least a week before the deadline). Good reasons for deviating from the required sections would be if you plan to submit your work to a conference or competition that requires a different organization, you are creating an interactive document that lends itself to a different organization. Below, I outline the points you must address in each section: 24.2.1 Introduction Your introduction should: introduce your application domain and the specific problem you’re working on, providing enough background for readers to understand the value of your project motivate your project overview your approach overview your results 24.2.2 Related work Your related work section should: discuss previous work done that relates to your project. For example, alternative approaches to the problem you’re trying to solve other examples of your particular approach in your domain or in another domain Your related work should include appropriate references to academic publications (e.g., found using google scholar, pubmed, etc.) A good related work section will likely reference (and overview) several related academic publications. 24.2.3 Methods Your methods section should: describe how you chose your data and/or how you collected your data describe your data mining pipeline in sufficient detail such that someone could replicate your project What data preprocessing did you perform? Which data mining algorithms did you apply (and how)? What postprocessing did you do? describe any analyses you performed to evaluate your model describe the software You may wish to include diagrams that overview methodology. 24.2.4 Results and discussion You results and discussion section should describe your results and discuss how your results fit into a broader context. You should include publication-quality visualizations that effectively communicate your results. Depending on the format you use for your final report, you may also wish to embed interactive visualizations. For example, you might present the performance of your data mining approach and discuss how it compares to a baseline/alternative method. 24.2.5 Conclusion Your conclusion should: very briefly summarize your findings discuss any limitations/shortcomings of your approach/experiments suggest future work (e.g., possible extensions to your project) 24.2.6 Data and software availability Your data and software availability section should: provide a working link to where your software can be found and downloaded (e.g., a github repository) provide a working link to where your data can be downloaded If either of those are not feasible for your project (e.g., you collected your own dataset and it’s huge), let me know at least a week before the deadline (the sooner you let me know, the better). 24.2.7 References Your references should be consistenly formatted such that a reader can find each reference (e.g., include authors, year, title, venue/journal, DOI). If you use Rmd, Bookdown, or LaTex to create your report, I can help you configure things such that your references are automatically formatted for you. 24.3 Deliverables Submit your report through Blackboard. If your report is a .pdf file, attach it to the submission. If your report is a live webpage, include a (working) link. One submission per group. Include in the comments section of the assignment the names of the group members. As part of your report, you will need to include working links to your code and data (e.g., in a github repository). 24.4 Grading Your final report will be graded on the following out of 100: Item Points Title accurately describes your project/findings 5 Introduction 10 Related work 10 Methods 10 Results and discussion 10 Conclusion 10 Data and software availability 10 References are consistently formatted 5 Code can be compiled/executed using provided instructions 10 Report is well-organized into proper sections, paragraphs follow logical structure 10 Report is sufficiently professional (few spelling and gramatical errors) 10 I reserve the right to award flex points for exemplary work in any areas of this project.
