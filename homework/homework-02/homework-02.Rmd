# Homework 2

## Overview

### Objectives

- Identify a public dataset (formatted as a .csv)
- Practice using R to load and view characteristics of a dataset
- Practice using ggplot2 to create visualizations

### Grading

- Part A is worth 40%
- Part B is worth 60%

## Setup

Create a new R Markdown file with the title "Homework 2" and with you as the author (hint: this information should be in your frontmatter at the top of the file).
For this assignment, you'll need to have the tidyverse collection of R packages installed.
If you haven't already, go ahead and install them by running `install.packages("tidyverse")`.

In your R markdown file, create a section heading for each of the following parts of your homework:

- Part A. Visualizing data with ggplot2
- Part B. Loading data in R

## Part A. Loading data in R

1. Find a publicly available dataset that is represented as a .csv file.
   Your chosen dataset should not be trivial (# rows * # columns should be at least 250 cells), and you may not choose the same dataset that I demonstrate in this week's lecture material.
   When choosing a dataset, keep in mind that you need to creating at least three different types of plots using your chosen dataset.
   You will upload the chosen data set as a .csv file along with your homework submission.

2. Tell me about your data set. Where did you get it? Who/what created it?

3. Load your dataset into a data frame (or a tibble, your choice)

4. Print the number of rows and columns (using R code)

5. Print the column names (using R)

6. If your dataset is not tidy, reformat it (using R code) to be tidy.

7. Use the `mutate` function (from the dplyr package) to add a column to your data frame. It's okay if the new column isn't useful.

## Part B. Visualizing data with ggplot2

Using ggplot2, create three different _types_ of plots (use at least three _different_ geoms) using your chosen data set from Part A.
Be creative!
Feel free to draw inspiration from [the R Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/).

On each of your plots, explicitly label your axes (e.g., using the `labs` function).
On at least one of your plots, use either the color or fill aesthetic.
